## Asignment 2
***Step1:***  
Write a c program where you define a function that takes two integers,  
swaps them, prints the swapped integers inside the function.
You don't need to think in terms pointers, pointers will be taught in one to two weeks.  
Pass values by copy into the function.  
***Step2:***  
Create a github repository and add the c source code into it.  
***Step3:***  
prepare the deliverables, and push them to the repo.  
send your BHOS email github repository link to your instructor's email
