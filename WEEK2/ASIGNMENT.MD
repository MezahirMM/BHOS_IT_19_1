## Asignment 2
***Step1:***  
Write a c program where you define a function that takes two integers,  
swaps them, prints the swapped integers inside the function.
Don't think about pointers, we will teach pointers in one to two weeks.  
Pass values by copy, just the simple way.  
***Step2:***  
Create a github repository and add the c source code into it.  
***Step3:***  
prepare the deliverables, and push them to the repo.  
link to the your BHOS email github repositories sent to the instructor's email
