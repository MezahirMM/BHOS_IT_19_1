## Asignment 2
***Step1:***  
Write a c program where you define a function that takes two integers,  
swaps them, prints the swapped integers inside the function.
Don't think about pointers, we will teach pointers in one to two weeks.  
Pass values by copy, just the simple way.  
***Step2:***  
Create a github repository and add the c source code into it.
